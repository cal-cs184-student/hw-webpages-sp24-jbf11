<p>
    Overall, this assignment deals with representations and processing of geometric entities. In the first part of this assignment, we implement Bezier curves and surfaces using de Casteljauâ€™s algorithm. We show how Bezier curves are smooth and demonstrate the steps of the algorithm. In the second part of this assignment, we perform mesh operations with the goal of mesh subdivision by the Loop algorithm. We implement methods that require traversal of the half edge mesh data structure, including computation of the vertex normal by area-weighted average of the face normals, flipping an edge in the mesh, and splitting an edge in the mesh. The first method is necessary for smooth Phong shading and the second and third are necessary for the Loop subdivision algorithm. We also develop an understanding of the Loop subdivision algorithm by applying it to several meshes to see how the geometry deforms and how properties of the underlying entities change. For extra credit, we completed the additional task of handling boundaries of triangular meshes, which is necessary for computing vertex normals, splitting edges, and performing Loop subdivision.
