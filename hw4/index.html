<div>

<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>

<p>
  In this assignment, we construct a grid of point masses connected by springs to simulate a cloth-like material. We use numerical integration to simulate the dynamics of such a system, handling collisions with objects and self-collisions. We also write a variety of shaders to capture various shading methods, including Blinn-Phong shading, texture mapping, displacement and bump mapping, and environment mapping. Overall, we construct a simple physically-based simulation that can render dynamics in real time.
</p>

<br>

<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>

<p>
  We implemented the point masses by adding them to a vector in row major order. We then constructed all the springs by considering the appropriate neighbor interactions (nearest neighbors for structural, diagonal neighbors for shearing, and skip interactions for bending).
</p>

<br>

<h3 align="left">Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs. Show us what the wireframe looks like (1) without any shearing constraints, (2) with only shearing constraints, and (3) with all constraints.</h3>

<p>
  The structural constraints appear as a structured square mesh representing the cloth. These constraints connect each point mass to its four orthogonal neighbors. The shearing constraints connect each point mass to its four diagonal neighbors, also forming a quadrilateral mesh. Lastly, the bending constraints connect each point mass to each orthogonal point two steps over.

<h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>

<h3 align="left">Experiment with some of the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again. You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing R. Describe the effects of changing the spring constant $\texttt{ks}$; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low $\texttt{ks}$? A high $\texttt{ks}$?</h3>

<p>
  With a low spring constant (10 N/m), the cloth behaves very loosely as it drops, with waves rippling through the sheet. With a high spring constant (10,000 N/m), it drops very rigidly. At rest, the low spring constant sheet drapes heavily, while the high spring constant has less effect.

  </table>
</div>
<br>

<h3 align="left">What about for $\texttt{density}$?</h3>

<p>
  A low-density (1 g/cm^2) cloth has very little weight, so as it falls, it does not pull the springs and cause large ripples. A dense (10,000 g/cm^2) cloth is heavier, so it drapes more and pulls itself toward the ground.
</p>

  <table style="width:100%">

    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<br>

<h3 align="left">What about for $\texttt{damping}$?</h3>

<p>
  Damping affects how much energy is lost as the springs move. With low damping, the cloth takes a long time to reach rest as it keeps swinging, as its energy dissipates very slowly (underdamped case). The cloth mesh is heavily distorted while it falls. With high damping, the cloth does not distort as much when it falls. It also does not swing as it falls, moving smoothly to its resting position. This occurs when damping dominates the oscillatory driving force of the spring constant (overdamped case).

  Below is the cloth with the default parameters in the four points pinned configuration at its resting state. We see the four corners are held and the cloth drapes relative to the corners. Blinn-Phong shading is employed.

<h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>

<p>
  We implemented object collisions as described in the problem statement by iterating over each point mass and treating the collisions mass-by-mass. For sphere collisions, we simply computed if the point mass was within the sphere, and if it was, we projected the point onto the sphere’s surface and then slightly off the surface to avoid planar intersections. This is because all three points of a triangle could be outside of the sphere, but the triangle itself could intersect the sphere. Adding a cushion decreases the risk of such a collision. For planar collisions, we computed if the previous position of the point and the current position were on different sides of the plane. If so, we projected the current position onto the surface of the plane, and as with the sphere case, projected it slightly further off the surface. This prevented numerical issues of struggling to differentiate on which side of the plane the point should be found on the next step.
</p>

<br>

<h3 align="left">Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from $\texttt{scene/sphere.json}$ in its final resting state on the sphere using the default $\texttt{ks = 5000}$ as well as with $\texttt{ks = 500}$ and $\texttt{ks = 50000}$. Describe the differences in the results.</h3>

<p>
  The weak strength cloth hugs the shape of the sphere and falls straight down. As the spring constant is increased, the cloth has more internal rigidity. The high strength cloth holds its shape and creases of the cloth stick out instead of down.

<h2 align="middle">Part IV: Handling self-collisions</h2>

<p>
  We implemented self collisions as described in the problem statement using a hash table. We chose box dimensions in all three dimensions and then assigned boxes in space integer-valued ordered triples based on their position relative to the origin (how many signed boxes away from the origin they were in each direction). To construct a single hash value for each box, we took the sum of the triple with each coordinate multiplied by an increasing multiple of pi. This way, each box had a unique floating point value, since pi is irrational, so the sum of an integer, an integer multiplied by pi, and an integer multiplied by pi squared will uniquely represent the ordered triple given by the integers. After constructing the hash table with all the points mapped to the corresponding bins, we then computed self collisions within each box of the domain. The shortcoming with this method is that two points could be arbitrarily close together, but fall in different boxes if the boundary between boxes was between them. A more complete algorithm could check for particles in all eight neighboring boxes as well and compute if any collisions occur. However, from the results below, we see that this is not sufficient for satisfactory dynamics in the cases below. Certainly, some cases would require more accurate simulations.
</p>

<br>

<h3 align="left">Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground).</h3>

<p>
  We see that the cloth falls and forms rolls on itself. When it reaches the ground, it very slowly relaxes since we encode no friction in the cloth, so it continues to slowly relax by unfolding, although the final screenshot shown is close to its final state.

<br>

<h3 align="left">Vary the $\texttt{density}$ as well as $\texttt{ks}$ and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.</h3>

<p>
  At low density, the cloth falls very slowly, which creates larger rolls as it folds over on itself. It is able to unfold since gravity has a weaker effect on it, leading to a resting state where it is nearly unfolded on the table. On the other hand, the high density cloth folds over itself several times as it falls quickly, leading to tighter rolls and the top of the cloth falling on top of all the rolls.

</div>
<br>

<p>
  At low spring constant, there are not strong forces between the elements of the mesh, so they fall and pull on each other weakly. This leads to a rougher cloth as the interactions are weaker between elements of the cloth leading to steeper bending angles in the folds of the cloth. When the spring constant is high, the cloth resists the bending deformation, leading to more rounded folds in the cloth as the neighboring bending angles are smaller. This gives a more natural looking cloth as it falls on itself.

<h2 align="middle">Part V: Shaders</h2>

<h3 align="left">Explain in your own words what a shader program is and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.</h3>
  
<p>
  A shader program is a program dedicated only to the coloring of a scene based on a simple lighting model designed to run efficiently in parallel on a GPU. This reduces rendering time such that real-time rendering is possible. A shader program consists of a vertex shader and a fragment shader. The vertex shader computes a vertex’s position in world space, its coordinates in some mapped space (e.g., for a texture map), its normal vector, and a tangent vector (both in world space). This computation possibly includes some manipulations, as in the bump mapping. It outputs the position in screen space for the vertex to be rendered. A fragment shader operates on samples, using the information provided by the vertex shader. The fragment shader uses the information from the vertices to compute the position and color in which to render the fragment in screen space.
</p>

<br>

<h3 align="left">Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screenshot only outputting the diffuse component, a screenshot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.</h3>

<p>
  The Blinn-Phong shading model is a physically-motivated lighting model that does not require ray tracing. It includes three contributions to the light intensity. First is an ambient contribution that is assumed to be uniform everywhere. Second is a diffuse contribution assumed to come from a point light source in which the reflected diffuse light is assumed to follow Lambert’s cosine law. Third is a specular contribution from the same point light source that is assumed to be focused in the mirror direction, with a parameter governing the narrowness of the focus. Together, these three contributions make for a visually satisfactory shading model for many applications, but lacks the complexity of a global light transport simulation.

Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using $\texttt{-o 16 -a 16}$ and then $\texttt{-o 128 -a 128}$.</h3>

<p>
  The bump map alters the angle at which light reflects off the surface, but does not change the position of the vertices that make up the sphere. This is visible by looking at the silhouette of the sphere. The bump map sphere is perfectly round, while the sphere with displacement mapping is irregular. The displacement map simply adds the vertex displacement on top of the shading, which adds an extra layer of realism.

  Compared to the coarser sphere, the fine sphere is similar with just bump mapping. However, with displacement mapping, the silhouette of the sphere closely conforms to the contour lines of the brick texture in the finer discretization. There are indents where there is mortar, and a raised profile at the bricks. In the coarse displacement mapped sphere, the edges do not as accurately depict the texture of bricks.

  We see a similar effect with the cloth. The silhouette of the cloth is significantly changed with displacement mapping, even though the lighting effect is similar. The cloth with bump mapping hangs straight down, while the cloth with texture has raised and indented areas.

<p>
  Joshua wrote the majority of the initial code. Dawson worked through and debugged the code, as well as writing the code for several subtasks. Together, all code was found to match the example renders provided and appeared to produce visually satisfactory results. The writing of the report was shared, as both partners understood and could discuss the entire assignment. Final renders were carried out by Dawson, and Joshua assembled the report in the HTML file.
